		<p>
			Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
			<br>
			Though both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where feedback provided to the agent is correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishment as signals for positive and negative behavior.
			<br>
			As compared to unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is different in terms of goals. While the goal in unsupervised learning is to find similarities and differences between data points, in reinforcement learning the goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent. The figure below represents the basic idea and elements involved in a reinforcement learning model.
